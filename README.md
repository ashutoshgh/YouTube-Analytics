# YouTube
 A basic repository that shows how to analyse YouTube channels
 
 Most of the code used in here is very basic and only serves the purpose of a simple analysis of any desired YouTube channel.

 The package used here is the 'soodoku/tuber' package which is available on GitHub. It can be found over here - https://github.com/soodoku/tuber
 
 This code focuses more on analysing playlists from a channel rather than the specific videos.
